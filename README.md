# Overview of the repository
This repository contains code and analyses conducted in the manuscript "Integrative genomic reconstruction reveals heterogeneity in carbohydrate utilization across human gut bifidobacteria".

## Abstract
Bifidobacteria are among the earliest colonizers of the human gut and are widely used as probiotics for their health-promoting properties. However, individual responses to probiotic supplementation may vary with strain type(s), microbiota composition, diet, or lifestyle conditions, highlighting the need for strain-level insights into the bifidobacterial metabolism of dietary and host glycans. Here, we systematically reconstructed 68 pathways involved in the utilization of mono-, di-, oligo-, and polysaccharides by analyzing the distribution of 589 curated metabolic functional roles (catabolic enzymes, transporters, transcriptional regulators) in 3083 non-redundant cultured *Bifidobacterium* isolates and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of human origin. Our analysis uncovered extensive inter- and intraspecies heterogeneity, including a distinct clade within the *Bifidobacterium*longum species capable of metabolizing Î±-glucans. We also identified isolates of Bangladeshi origin that harbor unique gene clusters implicated in the breakdown of xyloglucan and human milk oligosaccharides. Thirty-eight predicted carbohydrate utilization phenotypes were experimentally validated in 30 geographically diverse *Bifidobacterium* isolates in vitro. Our large-scale genomic compendium expands the knowledge of bifidobacterial carbohydrate metabolism and can inform the rational design of probiotic and synbiotic formulations tailored to strain-specific nutrient preferences.

## Reproducibility and accessibility
All code used in this analysis (including the Rmarkdown document used to compile this supplementary code file) is available on GitHub. Once the GitHub repo has been downloaded, navigate to `compendium_manuscript/` to find the Rmarkdown document as well as the RProject file. This should be your working directory for executing code.
1. To fully reproduce the phylogenetic analysis of 263 reference **Bifidobacterium** genomes, you will need to download FNA files from [Figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.26053936). Downloaded FNA files should be placed in `data/genomes/263_NR_ref_genomes/fna/`
2. Given the potential challenges with installing and running dbCAN, we provide processed dbCAN outputs in `data/CAZyme`
3. To fully reproduce the RNA-seq data analysis, you will need to download raw FASTQ files from Gene Expression Omnibus under accession [GSE239955](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE239955). Downloaded FASTQ files should be placed in `data/rnaseq/fastq/`. Otherwise, `data/rnaseq/kallisto/` already contains Kallisto mapping outputs
4. The pathway prediction pipeline **glycobif** used for additional 2820 genomes and MAGs is available in another [repository](https://github.com/Arzamasov/glycobif)
